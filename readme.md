üòÑ **About**

Currently, I am juggling between my studies and managing my [tech startup, RavSam](https://www.ravsam.in/). I am pursuing M.Tech in Computer Science and Technology at Guru Nanak Dev University and will be post-graduating in 2022.

</div>

I am a GNOME Foundation Member, where I contribute to Web and Engagement Teams. In 2019, I got a chance to redesign the [GTK Website](https://www.gtk.org/) as a Google Summer of Code Developer. That experience was life-changing for me as I learned some of the best software development practices from the GTK community.

üíª **Study and Work**

I love to explore new technologies. I use the following technologies to create data flows and amazing experiences for my clients and users. I try to automate almost everything that comes my way as it helps to improve my productivity and connection with my clients.

- **Python** - Almost Everywhere
- **Laravel** - Backend Development
- **Vue.js** - Front End Development
- **Flutter** - Cross-Platform App Development
- **Jekyll** - Static Site Generation
- **Netlify** - Deployment
- **Google Apps Script** - Automation and Serverless Things

üñäÔ∏è **Writing**

I love to write [blogs](https://www.ravsam.in/blog/) as it helps me in connecting with people in the community. I have written about 21912 words. Writing blogs have helped me get my first customers, so I suggest everyone document their journey or learnings in the form of a web blog.

üéπ **Music**

Sometimes I decide to get away from tech life and dive straight into music production. I have [my Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/ravdmusic), where you can remixes and originals.
